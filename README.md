#Statistics with Python Specialization by University of Michigan
This repository consists of python scripts that I have written for practice
while learning statistics with python from the [Statistics with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python)offered on Coursera by the University of Michigan. The specialization includes three courses. Practice and assignment are available for all three courses.

## Practice
#### The practice section includes code that explore the concepts that were learned each week.

1. [Multivariate Analysis using NHANES Data](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/Statistics_with_python_specialization/blob/master/Understanding_and_Visualizing_Data_With_Python/Week_3/utf-8''nhanes_multivariate_practice.ipynb)<br/>Multivariate analysis was conducted on categorical and numerical data using python. Statistical analysis such as p scores we also calculated to understand the correlation between two variables.

## Assignments
#### The assignment section includes the python assignments that were assigned for each week.

1. [Course 1: Week 3 Assignment](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/Statistics_with_python_specialization/blob/master/Understanding_and_Visualizing_Data_With_Python/Week_3/utf-8''w3_assessment.ipynb)<br/>In this assignment we'll plot multiple variables with scatterplots and bar graphs.
